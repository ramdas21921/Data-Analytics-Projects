**Conclusion**

Demand Dependency on Working/Non-working day:

*   With 95% Confidence, we can predict that demand for rented bikes is significantly higher on working days than on non-working days. It seems casual users wish to stay at home during non-working days and consistent registered users like delivery agents get less demand on non-working days.
*   The service provider should keep marketing or reaching out and focus on working days rather than non-working days to maximize sales and revenue.

Demand Dependency on Weather:

*   No. of average rides is increasing with clearer, sunny weather and getting hampered with cloudy and rainy days
*   Company XYZ must emphasize putting a close watch on the weather forecast and plan resources for clearer sunny days.
*   Higher discounts and marketing efforts are needed on relatively misty, cloudy, or rainy days to uplift the mean sale

Demand Dependency on Season:

*   With a significance level of 5%, using Kruskal test we conclude that demand is not the same in all seasons.
*   The fall season comes with the highest demand for renting bikes and the company XYZ must prepare the necessary resources to encash maximum.
*   Root cause analysis is needed for the lowest demand in the winter season including internal and external factors affecting and planning strategies to improve the same.

Relationship Between Season and weather and its impact on demand:

*   With Chi-Squared test, we have observed, that season and weather are dependent on each other.
*   The Fall season with partly cloudy days will get our logistics provider maximum demand in a day
*   Company XYZ must follow the weather forecasting thoroughly and place their effort in the right place

Revenue/Sales Enhancement Opportunity Quantification:
